**World_Weather_Assignment**

**Background:<br />**
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

**What You're Creating:<br />**
This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. You will submit the following deliverables:<br />

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data<br />
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map<br />
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map<br />

**Just a Note:<br />**
*I had so much fun with this assignment by creating my own dream iteneraries...one of my favorite routes is in our own hemispheres heading to the west coast starting in my home town of Lompoc, CA - Pacific Grove, CA - Coos Bay, OR - Portland, OR - Ucluelet, BC - Kenai, AK. I would stop off in San Fran, CA and Seattle, WA too, however those did not pop up in my list. Japan also looked like a fun place to explore. Anyhow, this assignment looks better with an intinerary in a full "driving" circle, so I took us to Europe! Thanks again.*
